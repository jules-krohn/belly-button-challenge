# belly-button-challenge

This repository contains code that creates an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catelogs the bacteria and other microbes that live in human belly buttons.

The code  includes: 
- a dropdown menu that changes the charts and demographic information based on subject ID
- a bar chart that includes the top ten operational taxonomic units (OTU) for each individual
- a bubble chart that visualizes OTU sample size

I collaborated with Thom Banninga for this project.

Colorscale for the bubble chart came from:https://plotly.com/javascript/colorscales/.

I used Chat GPT to generate simple code for the drop down menu, class activities to create the bar chart, and plotly.com/javascript/basic-charts for simple bubble chart code.
